Aim is to build PCB which performs motion sensor based light system.
1. Idea behind the project is one of the project which we done earlier(SMART HOUSE).
2. Passive  Infrared sensor is used to sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human was moved in or out of sensors range.
3. In Smart House Project we connected all sensors, resistors, arduino board on a breadboard. These are small, inexpensive,low-power.
4. Instead of breadboard here we are designing a pcb which has all resistors, capacitors, sensors embedded.
5. Designed PCB verified through DRC check.
